The file structure should be in the following

    cpp/
        annotate_mask/
        yolo-icp/
    Imo_models/
        models/
        models_eval/
    models/
        yolo_icp_correct_label2/
        yolo_icp_linemod/
    python/
    train_pbt/

The train_pbt is not uploaded because there are too many files. The train_pbt can be downloaded from the BOP website using the following link https://huggingface.co/datasets/bop-benchmark/lm/resolve/main/lm_train_pbr.zip. Extract all the files and place them into the working directory.
